# Andor 
## TV Show
### 2022

**A sequel to Rogue One, the show follows Cassian Andor, a small-time thief who becomes a key figure in the early Rebel Alliance.**  

_Andor stands apart from your typical Star Wars media by not follow the force or Skywalker family directly. It features a grounded tone with sharp writing and is closer to political espionage than your typical space opera spectacle._  

**_Focusing on ordinary people pushed into rebellion by an oppressive facist power, the show feels extremely modern and relevant._**
